== Description ==
This plugin allows your blog visitors to subscribe to your blog via email and receive notifications whenever you create a new post. You can control everything from the Wordpress admin.

Use the `<?php get_epicwin_box(); ?>` template tag to add a subscribe box anywhere on your Wordpress site.

**** IMPORTANT  *****
1. Since version 1.2 the plugin has switched the mail system from mail() to sendmail. Please update your plugin immediately if you are using a version older than 1.2.
2. Always remember to back up your data before upgrading the plugin as the re-installation of the plugin will wipe out all subscribers from the database.
3. Back up your subscribers by using the export options and then use the generated file to import them after the upgrade has been finished.

= 1.2 =
* The plugin now uses the Swiftmailer library to send emails. This is a major improvement from the last version since the last one was using the mail function mulitple times to send emails.
* Swiftmailer uses sendmail to send email so if your server does not support sendmail this plugin will not send emails when a new post is created.
* Created a section for email settings so now admins can change the subject and message fields on the email.
* Fixed a few gramatical errors as well as a few HTML syntax errors.

= 1.1 =
* Changed the code structure so it is more readable and allow for internationalization.
* Created a template tag so that it is possible to add the subscribe box anywhere in wordpress.
* This version fixes core functions that weren't working due to different settings between production and testing environments.

== Upgrade Notice ==
* It is very important that you update the plugin to the latest version because the old way the plugin was sending emails could really put a strain on a server.
* This version fixes core functions that weren't working due to diferente settigns between production and testing environments.
